## React Router Playground

##### A Basic implementation of react routing . 

 By default, **create-react-app** doesn't provide **react-router-dom** library.
 So we must need to execute following command inside the project for using
 routing things.

    npm install react-router-dom
    

For this project just execute `npm install ` command.
